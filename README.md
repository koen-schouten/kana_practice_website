# Kana Practise website

A simple website I made to practice the Japanese Kana.

To use this website, go [here](https://koen-schouten.github.io/kana_practice_website/index.html).

You can download or clone the repo and use Python to start a simple webserver in the main directory:

> python -m http.server

or

> python3 -m http.server
